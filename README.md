xmlToJson
=========

xmlToJson is a simple command line utility for Windows, written in C#, to convert an XML file to JSON. I use it in a Cygwin shell to process XML files produced by other tools into a format that can be piped into Elastic Search.

Usage: xmlToJson inputFileName.xml

The output is written to inputFileName.json.
